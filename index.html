		    <h3>Backwater </h3>
					<p>Standing by the sea, watch the sun make date with the dawn. Reconnect yourself with the backwaters of Kerala. There has always been some soothing power in the waves of the Sea. Lavish coastline, serene land, awesome weather with a coconut in hand, Kerala backwaters are surely one of its kind.</p>
